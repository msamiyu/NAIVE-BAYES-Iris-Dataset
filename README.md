# NAIVE-BAYES-Iris-Dataset
## Overview
Naive-Bayes is a supervised-learning algorithms whose main assumption is independent and uncorrelated features. The Naive-Bayes(NB) classifier makes predictions on the target variables with the help of the indepedent variables. It is Naive because it uses the independent and uncorrelated assumptions of the features (For example; A living thing is called a bird if it posseses features like wings, beak, feathers, e.t.c. which intuitively depends on each other. However, the NB classifier assumes that these features independently contributes to the probability that the living-thing is classified as a bird). The Iris dataset consists of different(3) species of flower with 150 records categorized by independent features such as SepalLengthCm, PetalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, and PetalWidthCm. The other feature is the "Species" which consist of 3-categories(virginica, versicolor and setosa).

## Motivation
Is there a simple machine learning classification algorithm that converges faster when training our model?. Can this be applied on a simple dataset to perform a classification and obtain its accuracy?.
## Goal 
Implement a Naive-Bayes Classifier algorithm on the Iris Dataset to estimate a posterior probability of a feature(Species) given some other features(SepalLengthCm, PetalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, and PetalWidthCm).
