# NAIVE-BAYES-Iris-Dataset
## Overview
Naive-Bayes is a supervised-learning algorithms whose main assumption is independent and uncorrelated features. The Naive-Bayes(NB) classifier makes predictions on the target variables with the help of the indepedent variables. It is Naive because it uses the independent and uncorrelated assumptions of the features (For example; A living thing is called a bird if it posseses features like wings, beak, feathers, e.t.c. which intuitively depends on each other. However, the NB classifier assumes that these features independently contributes to the probability that the living-thing is classified as a bird).The Iris dataset consists of different(3) species of flower with 150 records categorized by independent features such as sepal-length, petal-length, sepal-with, and petal-width
